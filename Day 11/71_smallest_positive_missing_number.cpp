Intuition:
The idea is to use array elements as an index. To mark the presence of an element x, change the value at the index x to negative. But this approach doesnâ€™t work if there are non-positive (-ve and 0) numbers. So segregate positive from negative numbers as the first step and then apply the approach.

Example:
Input array: [2,-1,-3,4,4,7]

Array after segregation: [2,4,4,7]. We ignore the negative integers.
To mark the presence of integer 2 we do arr[2-1]=-arr[2-1]. We do this only if arr[in] is positive initially. 
For 4 we do arr[4-1]=-arr[4-1].
Array after all operations = [2, -4, 4, -7]
So, the value at index 0 is positive. So 1 is the minimum positive number not present in the array.
